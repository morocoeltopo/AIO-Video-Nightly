/**
 * DownloadModelParser – Robust Model Cache and Recovery System
 *
 * A high-performance manager responsible for loading, validating, caching, and repairing
 * serialized DownloadDataModel instances from persistent storage.
 *
 * Core Responsibilities:
 * - Efficiently parse and load cached download models from disk or memory
 * - Maintain a centralized in-memory cache for quick access
 * - Recover gracefully from file corruption, deserialization errors, or missing data
 * - Ensure data integrity through validation and controlled write-back operations
 *
 * Key Features:
 * 1. **Automatic Recovery and Retry**
 *    - Detects corrupted or unreadable cache entries and attempts reprocessing.
 *    - Supports multiple recovery attempts before fallback to a safe default state.
 *
 * 2. **Failure Isolation**
 *    - Each model load occurs in an isolated coroutine scope to prevent cascading failures.
 *    - Faulty models are logged, skipped, and quarantined without interrupting other tasks.
 *
 * 3. **Thread-Safe Operations**
 *    - Uses Kotlin coroutines and synchronized blocks for concurrent access safety.
 *    - Guarantees atomic reads/writes to prevent race conditions.
 *
 * 4. **Cache Management**
 *    - Supports smart invalidation when model metadata changes.
 *    - Periodically verifies cache consistency and prunes obsolete entries.
 *
 * 5. **Performance-Oriented Design**
 *    - Leverages asynchronous I/O for faster disk reads.
 *    - Caches frequently accessed models in memory to reduce deserialization overhead.
 *
 * Logging & Diagnostics:
 * - All critical operations are logged using LogHelperUtils.
 * - Parsing errors, cache invalidations, and recovery events include stack trace details.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```
 * DownloadModelParser.loadAllModels()
 * DownloadModelParser.getCachedModel(downloadId)
 * DownloadModelParser.invalidateCache(downloadId)
 * ```
 *
 * This class is designed to ensure persistent, reliable, and recoverable state management
 * for downloads — even under storage corruption, app crashes, or interrupted I/O operations.
