/**
 * Central interface responsible for managing the application's download system.
 *
 * This interface defines the core mechanisms for controlling and monitoring all
 * download activities within the app. It handles task scheduling, progress tracking,
 * and communication between the download logic and the user interface.
 *
 * ### Key Responsibilities
 * - Manage active, paused, and completed downloads
 * - Control download lifecycle actions (start, pause, resume, delete)
 * - Maintain lists of running and queued download tasks
 * - Synchronize download states with the UI layer
 * - Perform cleanup of outdated or completed download data
 * - Enforce download policies and user preferences
 * - Handle automatic retention and cleanup of download records
 *
 * ### System Architecture
 * The download system follows a producer-consumer pattern where:
 * - Downloads are added to waiting queues
 * - A fixed number of parallel downloads execute concurrently
 * - Completed downloads are moved to finished collections
 * - Automatic cleanup occurs based on user-configured retention policies
 *
 * ### Thread Safety
 * Implementations should ensure thread-safe access to all collections and
 * proper synchronization when modifying download states across multiple threads.
 *
 * @see DownloadSystem for the primary implementation
 * @see DownloadDataModel for the data structure representing downloads
 * @see DownloadTaskInf for individual download task execution
