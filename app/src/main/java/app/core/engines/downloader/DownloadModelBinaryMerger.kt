/**
 * DownloadModelMerger - Merges and Maintains a Unified Binary of Download Models
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * 1. Periodically checks individual JSON model files and merges them into a single binary file.
 * 2. Keeps the merged binary up-to-date by comparing modification timestamps.
 * 3. Provides fast retrieval of merged models to reduce I/O overhead.
 * 4. Runs in a background thread to avoid blocking the main thread.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Thread-safe operations using AtomicBoolean and @Synchronized
 * - Single-threaded executor to serialize merge operations
 * - Incremental updates based on file timestamps
 * - Avoids unnecessary writes if the merged file is already up-to-date
